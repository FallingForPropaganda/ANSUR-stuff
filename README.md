 Copied over from my main so I don't dox myself

 Messing around with ANSUR datasets

 Yeah I'm gonna be honest I'm kinda shit at coding so don't expect good things here

 UPDATE: PASSOID DETECTOR WORKING

 Enter your measurements and you will be given a passing score. Closer to 0 is better, but anything from -1 to +1 is probably good enough to pass

 UPDATE: what_it_could_have_been COMPLETED

 Enter your measurements from before hrt (assuming you were an adult) and it will tell you what they would have been had you been born opposite your AGAB
